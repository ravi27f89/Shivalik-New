## `Technical Specification`
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**
MVVM Architecture to organize code in a clean and efficient way, with building user interface. Seperate structural code for viewing logic and data. Quick to access and test.
    - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. (Property.swift,Category.swift)
    - **View**: The user interface (UI) that the user interacts with. In Swift, this is often your SwiftUI views or UIKit components.
    - **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It takes data from the Model, processes it if needed, and provides it to the View in a way thatâ€™s easy to display.
  

SwiftUI offers an intuitive way to design user interfaces across all Apple platforms, harnessing the power of Swift.
